    "content": "<p class=\"blog-intro\">If you’ve built a React app using Vite and want to get it online fast, Hostinger makes the whole process surprisingly simple. I recently deployed my portfolio website—and yes, the blog you’re currently reading—using these exact steps.</p>\n\n<p>Everything went live in less than an hour, even though the DNS migration took longer globally. Here’s exactly how I did it.</p>\n\n<h3><span class=\"blog-serial\">01.</span> What You Need</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>A Hostinger hosting plan</li>\n    <li>A working React + Vite project</li>\n    <li>A custom domain (either from Hostinger or mapped externally)</li>\n    <li>A few minutes of time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><span class=\"blog-serial\">02.</span> Build Your Vite App</h3>\n<p>Inside your project, run the build command to create your production files:</p>\n<pre><code>npm run build</code></pre>\n<p>This creates the <span class=\"blog-highlight\">dist/</span> folder with all production files.</p>\n\n<h3><span class=\"blog-serial\">03.</span> Uploading Files to Hostinger</h3>\n<p>I actually tested two deployment methods:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 1 – Upload ZIP (works but not the simplest)</strong></p>\n<p>I initially zipped my <span class=\"blog-highlight\">dist/</span> folder and uploaded it to Hostinger. It works, but it isn’t the fastest method.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method 2 – Direct Upload (the easiest & the method used for this blog)</strong></p>\n<p>This is the method I used when deploying both my personal portfolio and the blog you’re reading right now:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Open <strong>hPanel → File Manager</strong></li>\n    <li>Navigate to <strong>public_html</strong></li>\n    <li>Upload all files and folders directly from the <strong>dist/</strong> folder</li>\n    <li>Delete any default Hostinger files (like <em>index.php</em>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No extraction. No complications. Just drag → upload → done.</p>\n\n<h3><span class=\"blog-serial\">04.</span> Fixing Routing (Important)</h3>\n<p>If you are using React Router (like I am), you might face issues where refreshing a page gives a 404 error. To fix this, you need to create an <strong>.htaccess</strong> file in your <strong>public_html</strong> folder.</p>\n<p>Add the following code to it:</p>\n<div class=\"code-editor\">\n  <div class=\"editor-header\">\n    <span class=\"editor-dot red\"></span>\n    <span class=\"editor-dot yellow\"></span>\n    <span class=\"editor-dot green\"></span>\n    <span class=\"file-name\">.htaccess</span>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"editor-content\">\n    <pre><code>RewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\n\n# Serve existing files normally\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\n\n# Redirect everything else to index.html (SPA routing)\nRewriteRule . /index.html [L]</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This ensures that all requests are handled by your React app, preventing 404 errors on page refresh.</p>\n\n<h3><span class=\"blog-serial\">05.</span> Custom Domain Mapping</h3>\n<p>This part surprised me a bit:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Hostinger mentions domain propagation can take up to <strong>24 hours</strong></li>\n    <li>My site was accessible in <strong>under 1 hour</strong></li>\n    <li>Full global propagation completed after ~24 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So even though DNS takes time to update everywhere, you can still access your website quickly.</p>\n\n<h3><span class=\"blog-serial\">06.</span> Install Free SSL</h3>\n<p>Inside hPanel:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Go to <strong>Security → SSL → Install</strong></li>\n    <li>Hostinger automatically issues a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate</li>\n    <li>Your site becomes HTTPS instantly without additional setup</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3><span class=\"blog-serial\">07.</span> No Backend or Database Needed</h3>\n<p>Since this was only a <strong>React + Vite</strong> frontend project, I didn’t configure:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>any database</li>\n    <li>any backend API</li>\n    <li>any server-side code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just simple static hosting — perfect for a portfolio, personal blog, or landing page.</p>\n\n<h3><span class=\"blog-serial\">08.</span> Result: My Portfolio + This Blog Is Live</h3>\n<p>Within an hour:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>My React app was live</li>\n    <li>My custom domain was connected</li>\n    <li>SSL was activated</li>\n    <li>Everything worked perfectly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This exact blog post you're reading right now was deployed using these same steps.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"With Vite, the deployment becomes: <strong>build → upload → connect domain → done.</strong>\"</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want the simplest way to publish a portfolio or static React site, Hostinger is ideal. No complex setup. No backend required. Just clean and fast hosting.</p>"
